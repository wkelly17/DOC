# * http://localhost:3000 covers requests originating from the case
# where 'npm run dev' is invoked to run vite (to run svelte js frontend)
# outside Docker. This results in vite's development mode which runs on
# port 3000.
# * http://localhost:8001 covers requests originating from the case
# where 'npm run build' is invoked which executes a vite build. Docker
# then copies built assets to nginx environment which then serves them
# on port 80 which is then mapped to port 8001 in docker-compose.yml.
# * http:localhost:4173 covers requests originating from the case where
# 'npm run preview' is invoked which executes serving the built for
# production (via 'npm build') frontend locally in a
# non-production-grade web server.
